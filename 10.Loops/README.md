For traversing list,string,tuples etc.

    for el in list:
        #some work

# FOR LOOP WITH ELSE

    for el in list:
        #some work
    else:
        #work when loop ends

# range()

Range functions returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1(by default), and stops before a specified number.

    range(start?,stop,step?)
