# TUPLES

    A built-in data type that lets us create immutable sequence of values.
    Like strings they are immutable
    tup = ("A","B","C")
    tup[0] = "D" => Not allowed

    tup = ( ) => Valid
    tup = (1) => Consider as int type
    tup = (1,)=> Valid tuple

# TUPLE METHODS

    tup.index(el) => returns index of first occurence of el
    tup.count(el) => returns count of total occurence of el
